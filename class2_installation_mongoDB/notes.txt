goto website https://www.mongodb.com/   ->  products   -> Community Server  ->

download the suggested version for your system   ->  install after download

->      C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin 

now insure the mongoDB installed properly or not

go to cmd  ->  go to location in cmd ( use double inverted ) "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin\mongod.exe" --version

if you are getting this type of output then system set be with mongiDB

db version v5.0.8
Build Info: {
    "version": "5.0.8",
    "gitVersion": "c87e1c23421bf79614baf500fda6622bd90f674e",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "tcmalloc",
    "environment": {
        "distmod": "windows",
        "distarch": "x86_64",
        "target_arch": "x86_64"
    }
}


Now do same for mongo 

go to cmd  ->  go to location in cmd ( use double inverted ) "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin\mongo.exe" --version

if you are getting this type of output then system set be with mongiDB

MongoDB shell version v5.0.8
Build Info: {
    "version": "5.0.8",
    "gitVersion": "c87e1c23421bf79614baf500fda6622bd90f674e",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "tcmalloc",
    "environment": {
        "distmod": "windows",
        "distarch": "x86_64",
        "target_arch": "x86_64"
    }
}

Now to run the go to "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin" and run "mongo.exe"



Now run address in cmd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin\mongo.exe"
if you are getting ">" sign after above running then all is set.

now if you type in cmd
>  show dbs

then you will get by default dbs available in system
admin   0.000GB
config  0.000GB
local   0.000GB


Now to run the mongo everytime we need to type address  on cmd
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin\mongo.exe"
to prevent from this long process we need to set system environment.

to set environment:- search "edit system environment" and enter into into
inside new table -> environment variables -> path -> new ->
paste "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin" and  OK -> OK


now if you enter in cmd  "mongo --version"
and get result as 

MongoDB shell version v5.0.8
Build Info: {
    "version": "5.0.8",
    "gitVersion": "c87e1c23421bf79614baf500fda6622bd90f674e",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "tcmalloc",
    "environment": {
        "distmod": "windows",
        "distarch": "x86_64",
        "target_arch": "x86_64"
    }
}


now if you enter in cmd  "mongod --version"
and get result as 

db version v5.0.8
Build Info: {
    "version": "5.0.8",
    "gitVersion": "c87e1c23421bf79614baf500fda6622bd90f674e",
    "modules": [],
    "allocator": "tcmalloc",
    "environment": {
        "distmod": "windows",
        "distarch": "x86_64",
        "target_arch": "x86_64"
    }
}

then environment variable also set
